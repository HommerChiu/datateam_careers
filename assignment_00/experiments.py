"""
Read the competition description and get the raw dataset. Design features for
the competition and write code to do the preprocessing. Send us your workable
code and briefly explain why you chose those features.


Things you can do:
    * Build your own features and manipulate the raw dataset.
    * Read assignment_01 and process the raw dataset as its description.
    * Do it without pandas.
    * Do it with multiprocessing.
    * Do it with pyspark.

Note:
    * THIS IS NO BIG DATA. Your code must process the entire dataset.
    * Although this is not a coding style test, please make the code readable,
      please...

FYR:
    On a normal machine (Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4440 CPU @ 3.10GHz), the entire
    dataset can be transformed to the version for assignment_01 within 5
    minutes (without optimization).
