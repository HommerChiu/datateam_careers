## Whiteboard Coding Test

> Before you are a data scientist, you must be a programmer.

There will be a whiteboard coding test during the interview. However, we have different expectations comparing to the other teams. It is good if you can come up with a solution during the test. If you can't, we will guide you to solve the problem. The bottom line is, you are expected to complete the code after we revealing the details of the solution. Here are 2 samples.

``` python
def to_odd_even(nums):
    """
    given an integer list, rearrange it so that all odd integers are placed
    before even integers.
    """


def to_negative_zero_positive(nums):
    """
    given an integer list, rearrange it so that all negative integers are
    placed before zeros, and all zeros are placed before positive integers.
    """
```
